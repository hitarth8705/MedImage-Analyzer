# MedImage-Analyzer



A web-based medical image analysis application that uses machine learning to detect various diseases from medical images including MRI scans and X-rays.

## 🏥 Features

- **Multi-Disease Detection**: Supports detection of:
  - Brain Tumors (MRI)
  - Alzheimer's Disease (MRI)
  - Pneumonia (X-ray)
- **Image Upload Interface**: Simple web interface for uploading medical images
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Machine learning models for accurate disease detection
- **Detailed Results**: Provides diagnosis along with:
  - Estimated recovery time
  - Potential causes
  - Recovery recommendations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- Required ML libraries (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- PIL/Pillow for image processing



## 🔬 How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: Users upload medical images through the web interface
2. **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate disease detection model
3. **AI Analysis**: The selected model processes the image
4. **Results Display**: The system returns:
   - Disease detection results
   - Confidence scores
   - Medical recommendations
   - Recovery timeline

## 🎯 Supported Image Types

- **Brain Tumor Detection**: MRI scans (JPEG, PNG)
- **Alzheimer's Detection**: Brain MRI scans (JPEG, PNG)
- **Pneumonia Detection**: Chest X-rays (JPEG, PNG)


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Jinja2 templating
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- **Image Processing**: PIL/Pillow
- **Web Framework**: Flask

## 📋 Usage

1. Access the web application
2. Click "Choose File" to upload a medical image
3. Select the appropriate disease type from the dropdown
4. Click "Upload" to process the image
5. View the analysis results including:
   - Disease detection outcome
   - Uploaded image preview
   - Recovery recommendations
